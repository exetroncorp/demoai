Okay, I can help you with that\!

## Ollama: Using a Custom Registry

You can configure Ollama to pull models from a custom registry instead of the default `registry.ollama.ai`. Here are a couple of ways to do it:

1.  **Environment Variable**:

      * Set the `OLLAMA_REGISTRY_URL` environment variable to the URL of your custom registry.
        ```bash
        export OLLAMA_REGISTRY_URL="https://your-custom-registry.com"
        ```
      * Restart Ollama after setting this variable.
      * Now, when you run `ollama pull <model_name>` or `ollama run <model_name>`, Ollama will attempt to fetch the model from your specified registry.

2.  **Fully Qualified Model Names**:

      * You can also specify the full URL of the model in your custom registry directly when pulling or running a model:
        ```bash
        ollama run your-custom-registry.com/namespace/model_name:tag
        ```
      * This approach is also applicable when defining models in a `Modelfile` using the `FROM` instruction.

3.  **Kubernetes Configuration**:

      * If you're running Ollama in a Kubernetes environment, you can set the `OLLAMA_REGISTRY_URL` environment variable within your deployment YAML file for the Ollama container.

These methods allow you to manage and distribute your Ollama models through your own infrastructure.

## Hugging Face: Using a Mirror

To use a mirror for Hugging Face models and datasets, you can primarily use an environment variable:

1.  **HF\_ENDPOINT Environment Variable**:

      * Set the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment variable to the URL of your Hugging Face mirror.
        ```bash
        export HF_ENDPOINT="https://your-huggingface-mirror.com"
        ```
      * Many Hugging Face libraries and tools (like `huggingface_hub`, `transformers`, `datasets`) will automatically use this endpoint for downloading files.
      * For example, after setting this variable, when you use `AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')` in your Python script, it should attempt to download from your mirror.

2.  **Specific Library Arguments**:

      * Some functions within the Hugging Face ecosystem might offer a specific `mirror` or `endpoint` argument. For example, the `from_pretrained` method in older versions of `transformers` or specific community tools might have such parameters. However, relying on `HF_ENDPOINT` is the more general and recommended approach.

3.  **huggingface-cli**:

      * The `huggingface-cli` tool also respects the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment variable. You can use it to download models or datasets:
        ```bash
        huggingface-cli download --resume-download model_name --local-dir ./model_name
        ```

4.  **Self-Hosted Mirror Services**:

      * There are community projects (like "Olah" found on GitHub) that allow you to set up your own self-hosted Hugging Face mirror. These services will have their own configuration instructions, often involving setting environment variables or using configuration files to point your tools to the local mirror.

Using a mirror can be particularly helpful for users in regions with slow connectivity to the official Hugging Face servers or for organizations that want to cache assets locally.
